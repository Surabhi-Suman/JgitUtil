# JgitUtil

This is a utility for automating multiple tasks of cloning, creating a branch , updating pom dependencies and pushing the changes back to the repository.
In the large network of microservices, if we we want to update any common dependecy version to all the microservices, updating one by one can be
quite a tedious work, to save some effort this utility can further be enhanced to handle such scenarious.
